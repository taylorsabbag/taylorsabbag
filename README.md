# üëãüèº Hi there

I'm currently the **lead software engineer** at Evexia Inc. building a *real* revolution in mental health.

I code mostly for the web using technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, React, React Native, HTML, CSS, Node, Express.js, Next.js, Svelte, SvelteKit, SQL, PostgresSQL, and MySQL. Yeah, that's a lot, but such is the web these days. However, I love going deep particularly on understanding the eccentricities and capabilities of JavaScript and the web APIs. I use Git and GitHub to manage my software versioning.

I currently live in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (near Toronto if you're from outside Canada), but I'm open to opportunities around the world!

## Things About Me

- I started developing for the web when pixel-perfection was still viable, Flash ruled the world, responsive design was just a twinkle in Ethan Marcotte's eye, and tables were used for basically everything.
- I attended a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and a Master of Arts in Counselling Psychology at Wilfrid Laurier University and Yorkville University, respectively.
  - Don't worry. I can't read minds...yet.
- I also love food, cooking, board games, puzzles, escape rooms, travel, and exploring other cultures.
- I'm currently learning Dutch and Hebrew.

Named after the Greek word for "wellness", we are striving to bridge the gap between the amount of therapy we need and the amount of therapists and mental health providers there are. We're building a new approach to therapy and making supplemental resources for mental health to help tackle the growing crisis.

In addition, the app includes a robust logging and access tracking system and the ability to stream CSVs to automatically parse and generate data.
